# Superconductor Temperatures
This repository contains .py scripts predicting the critical temperatures of superconductors

All data comes from the [UCI repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/superconductivty+data)

Due to the large data dimensions, I explored techniques in dimensionality reduction (principal component analysis) as well as various regressor algorithms to benchmark performance scenarios
